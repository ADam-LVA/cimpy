CIMpy
==================================

The CIMpy package allows the import, modification, and export of network data described by XML/RDF documents according to the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard.

The processing of network data is based on Python classes compatible with CIM. The code basis for the CIM-compatible Python classes was generated automatically. A separately developed tool allows the easy adaptation of CIMpy and its underlying code basis.

So far the focus of CIMpy was the support of the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) specified by the Association of European Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E). However, the CIMpy package can easily support additional and newly released CIM versions if required.
